This, however, is not always the case as seen in the image to the right. Nature will always reclaim and complement architecture if conditions are right. The presence of nature adds a complex layer of beauty that architects can not create because it is unpredictable and natural. Such beauty is rarely appreciated. </div>

This aspect of architecture is much clearer in older structures because materials were often handmade before technological advancements made construction easier. Thus, the pieces of the earth are easier to identify. </div>
